# Log4j overview related software

This page contains an overview of any related software regarding the Log4j vulnerability. On this page NCSC-NL will maintain a list of all known vulnerable and not vulnerable software. Futhermore any reference to the software will contain specific information regarding which version contains the security fixes, and which software still requires mitigation. Please note that this vulnerability may also occur in custom software developed within your organisation. These occurrences are not registered in this overview.

NCSC-NL will use the following status:

| Status         | Description                  |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------|
| Vulnerable     | Software is vulnerable for CVE-2021-44228. |
| Fix            | Software contains a fix for CVE-2021-44228 |
| Workaround | Software is vulnerable but mitigation steps are available |
| Not vuln     | Software is **NOT** vulnerable for CVE-2021-44228. |
| Investigation     | Software is under investigation whether it is vulnerable or not |

The `Version` relates to the `Status` column. If `Status` is Vulnerable, Version indicates vulnerable version(s). If `Status` is Fix, Version indicates the fixed version(s).

**NCSC-NL has published a HIGH/HIGH advisory for the Log4j vulnerability. Normally we would update the HIGH/HIGH advisory for vulnerable software packages, however due to the extensive amounts of expected updates we have created a list of known vulnerable software in the software directory.**
