# Overview of software (un)affected by Log4j

This directory contains [an overview of software (un)affected by the Log4shell vulnerabilities](software_list.md). NCSC-NL and partners are attempting to maintain a list of all known vulnerable and not vulnerable software. Listed software is paired with specific information regarding which version contains the security fixes and which software still requires fixes. Please note that this vulnerability may also occur in custom software developed within your organisation. These occurrences are not registered in this overview.

#### NCSC Advisories
NCSC-NL has published a HIGH/HIGH advisory for the Log4j vulnerability. Normally we would update the HIGH/HIGH advisory for vulnerable software packages, however due to the extensive amounts of expected updates we have created a list of known vulnerable software in the software directory.

#### Daily CSV/JSON releases
Daily releases of this software list are listed, including CSV and JSON files, in the [releases](https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/releases) overview. Please check the [software list parser](https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/tree/main/tools/log4shell_softwarelist) tool to generate a CSV or JSON on your own.

If `Status` is set to 'Fix', the `Version` field indicates the version(s) in which the fix was introduced. Some products do not have clear version numbers, in which case the `Version` field is empty.
