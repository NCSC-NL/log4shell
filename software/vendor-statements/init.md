Dear Customer

We would like to refer to the recently discovered critical security risk concerning the Java library [log4j](https://newslettertogo.com/wq37zux3-w7nrbmnl-fgu4davq-pan) in combination with our software products.

The library is not used in our products MOBILE-PERDIS, AppComm and WebComm. This means that there is no risk for you when using these products.

In MOBILE-PLAN the affected library is used in versions 4.22.* as well as 5.*. However, due to the fact that MOBILE-PLAN is not accessible from the Internet, the risk is considered to be rather low. We are already working on a solution and will make it available to you soon.

If you have any further questions or concerns, your usual INIT MSS contact person is always available.

Best regards
Your team at INIT Mobility Software Solutions GmbH
