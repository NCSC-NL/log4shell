# Log4j Microsoft Defender queries

### Find callback connections
Possible Malicious Indicators in Cloud Application Events. This query is designed to flag exploitation attempts for cases where the attacker is sending the crafted exploitation string using vectors such as User-Agent, Application or Account name. The hits returned from this query are most likely unsuccessful attempts, however the results can be useful to identity attackersâ€™ details such as IP address, Payload string, Download URL, etc.

```plain
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > datetime("2021-12-09")
| where UserAgent contains "jndi:" 
or AccountDisplayName contains "jndi:"
or Application contains "jndi:"
or AdditionalFields contains "jndi:"
| project ActionType, ActivityType, Application, AccountDisplayName, IPAddress, UserAgent, AdditionalFields
```
